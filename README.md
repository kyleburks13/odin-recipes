Building a basic recipe website
I'll have written out the foundational HTML code to build the
web pages and link then to each other. As well as I may learn
how to actually connect it to the internet. I should be learning
and/or practicing/reviewing how to commit and praciting good
commit practices like 50 character subject lines, 72 character 
body lines, and what, why, how in the body.
UPDATE: "foundational HTML code" is correctly referred to as
boilerplate HTML.
